## Module 8 Reflection – CS330 Final Project

### How do I approach designing software?
I usually start with a visual plan or idea of what I want the project to look like. For this one, I broke the scene into separate objects like tents, fires, and props. That helped me structure the code around each item.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to think about layout in 3D space, using X, Y, and Z axes. I also learned how to use textures and lighting to make it feel more like a real scene.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a rough design > build > test loop. I’d sketch ideas, build pieces one at a time (like the campfire), and test how it all looked together.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I’ll definitely break bigger projects down into small objects or parts. That made it easier to focus and fix problems step by step.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I like to get something on screen quickly, even if it’s not perfect. That gives me confidence to improve it. I usually work on one section at a time.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I learned to apply shaders, use textures properly, and combine shapes to create complex objects. I also learned how to handle camera movement and lighting in OpenGL.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
A lot. I would build, test, tweak something, then test again. The wine glass was a good example — I remade it three times until it looked right.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
I’ve gotten better at organizing my code and thinking in reusable chunks. I’ve also gotten more confident using OpenGL and understanding how shapes and textures work together.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want to be a software engineer, and being able to create visual apps, games, or simulations is a great skill. This course helped build confidence in that.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I learned the basics of rendering and 3D environments, which I can use in future graphics or game development classes.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Understanding 3D rendering and OpenGL gives me a big advantage if I work in graphics, game dev, or even simulation software. It also shows I can handle visual thinking and interactive design.
